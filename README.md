Weather.py

As-is, this project scraped the web for weather data daily (frequency can easily be shortened for more thorough results) by simply
running a bash script as a cronjob that downloaded the html file for Buffalo, NY found at http://www.weather.com each day.

I'll be updating this in the future to make it more user-friendly, right now it's basically just the original script that I used to do
some one-time analysis on the accuracy/dependability of weather forecasts.

The data contained in the project accounts for about 2 months of weather data in Buffalo, NY between the months of February and April, 2014.
